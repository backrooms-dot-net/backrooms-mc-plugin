# Backrooms.net MC
Backrooms plugin for backrooms.net Minecraft servers.

# Installation

Backrooms server plugin is NOT a mod. That means, you must 
install the plugin into a Minecraft server.

To install ...
1. Stop the server. 
2. Place the plugin into the 'plugins' folder on the server. 
3. Delete the existing overworld.
4. Start the server and let the overworld regenerate.

# Season 2 (Current Release)

This Backrooms Minecraft plugin treats the overworld as the Frontrooms. 
You spawn into the backrooms when you first join. Then your goal is
to find a way out of the backrooms into the overworld.

The backrooms generates in a NEW world as the lowest level of the world. 
It is as large as the overworld in size.

If you die for any reason, before or after escaping the backrooms, you
are respawned back into the backrooms. This makes your world nearly as
challenging as a hardcore world, without the permanent loss of access
to the overworld that you get in normal hardcore worlds.

Backrooms Season 2 acts as a better option than hardcore mode.  

## Version
Minecraft 1.20.1 is the target version of the plugin, but there 
is no reason it wouldn't run on other versions. Test it, if you want.
